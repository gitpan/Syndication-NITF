=head1 Syndication::NITF -- a NITF v3.0 library for Perl

=end text

Syndication::NITF is an object-oriented Perl interface to NITF documents, allowing
you to manage (and one day create) NITF documents without any specialised NITF
or XML knowledge.

NITF is a standard format for the markup of textual news content (eg newspaper and
magazine articles), ratified by the International Press Telecommunications
Council (http://www.iptc.org). 

This module supports the version 3.0 DTD of NITF. It makes no attempt to support eariler versions
of the DTD.

or B<http://www.iptc.org/>

=head1 LATEST VERSION AND WHAT'S NEW

The latest version is 0.01, released 1 November 2001.

Download: http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/B/BQ/BQUINN/

=head2 What's New in 0.01:

=over 4

=item *

B<Everything>

This is still very basic. It really just traverses NITF documents, giving
users a few helper functions. Future releases will include many methods to
handle NITF tables, organisation and currency tags, etc.

=head1 INSTALLING Syndication::NITF

The lazy way to install Syndication::NITF:

   $ perl -MCPAN -e shell
   cpan> install Syndication::NITF

Or the normal way:

Retrieve the latest copy from CPAN: http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/B/BQ/BQUINN/

   $ perl Makefile.PL # Creates the Makefile
   $ make             # Runs the makefile
   $ make test        # Optional (See Interopability below)
   $ make install     # Installs Syndication::NITF into  your Perl library location

With this method you will first have to install the pre-requisite module XML::DOM.
See L<what are the prerequisites?>.

=head2 What Are The Prerequisites?

=over 4

=item * 

XML::DOM (Have not tested lower than v1.27) 

=item *

Perl5 (Have not tested lower than v5.6) 

=back

To get the latest versions of the prerequisite module you can simply type this at the command prompt:

   $ perl -MCPAN -e shell
   cpan> install XML::DOM

or if you just 'install Syndication::NITF' the CPAN module should automagically install all of the prerequisites for you.

=head2 What Systems Does It Work With?

Syndication::NITF B<should> work on any machine that supports XML::DOM, and any filesystem including Windows,
although I haven't tested it on Windows yet. It's still early days, so expect some bugs.

=head1 WHERE ARE THE MANUALS?

Once you've installed, you can type: 

   $ perldoc Syndication::NITF

=for html
<P>Or you can view them starting from here:
<A HREF="Syndication-NITF.html">Syndication::NITF</A>,

=head1 GETTING HELP

The best place to ask questions now would be the NITF mailing list at
B<http://groups.yahoo.com/group/nitf/>, or ask
me directly at brendan\@clueful.com.au. If there is enough demand we may start up a specialised list.

General Perl/XML questions should be asked on the Perl-XML mailing list, which you can find at
B<http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Browse/Threaded/perl-xml>

=head1 THE TEST SUITE & INTEROPERABILITY

The standard C<make test> test suite checks most elements in a small range of test NITF documents
obtained from the Net. You can find the test documents in the C<t/test_data/> directory.

=head1 BUGS and TODO

There are probably bugs all over the place -- this is still an early version.

At the moment, C<Syndication::NITF> only reads NITF files -- in the future it should be able to modify and
write them as well.
