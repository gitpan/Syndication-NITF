Syndication::NITF -- a NITF v3.0 library for Perl
    Syndication::NITF is an object-oriented Perl interface to NITF
    documents, allowing you to manage (and one day create) NITF documents
    without any specialised NITF or XML knowledge.

    NITF is a standard format for the markup of textual news content (eg
    newspaper and magazine articles), ratified by the International Press
    Telecommunications Council (http://www.iptc.org).

    This module supports the version 3.0 DTD of NITF. It makes no attempt to
    support eariler versions of the DTD.

    You can find out more about NITF at http://www.nitf.org/ or
    http://www.iptc.org/

LATEST VERSION AND WHAT'S NEW
    The latest version is 0.01, released 1 November 2001.

    Download: http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/B/BQ/BQUINN/

  What's New in 0.01:

    *   Everything

        This is still very basic. It really just traverses NITF documents,
        giving users a few helper functions. Future releases will include
        many methods to handle NITF tables, organisation and currency tags,
        etc.

    See the Changes file for previous releases.

INSTALLING Syndication::NITF
    The lazy way to install Syndication::NITF:

       $ perl -MCPAN -e shell
       cpan> install Syndication::NITF

    Or the normal way:

    Retrieve the latest copy from CPAN:
    http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/B/BQ/BQUINN/

       $ perl Makefile.PL # Creates the Makefile
       $ make             # Runs the makefile
       $ make test        # Optional (See Interopability below)
       $ make install     # Installs Syndication::NITF into  your Perl library location

    With this method you will first have to install the pre-requisite module
    XML::DOM. See the what are the prerequisites? entry elsewhere in this
    document.

  What Are The Prerequisites?

    *   XML::DOM (Have not tested lower than v1.27)

    *   Perl5 (Have not tested lower than v5.6)

    To get the latest versions of the prerequisite module you can simply
    type this at the command prompt:

       $ perl -MCPAN -e shell
       cpan> install XML::DOM

    or if you just 'install Syndication::NITF' the CPAN module should
    automagically install all of the prerequisites for you.

  What Systems Does It Work With?

    Syndication::NITF should work on any machine that supports XML::DOM, and
    any filesystem including Windows, although I haven't tested it on
    Windows yet. It's still early days, so expect some bugs.

WHERE ARE THE MANUALS?
    Once you've installed, you can type:

       $ perldoc Syndication::NITF

GETTING HELP
    The best place to ask questions now would be the NITF mailing list at
    http://groups.yahoo.com/group/nitf/, or ask me directly at
    brendan\@clueful.com.au. If there is enough demand we may start up a
    specialised list.

    General Perl/XML questions should be asked on the Perl-XML mailing list,
    which you can find at
    http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Browse/Threaded/perl-xml

THE TEST SUITE & INTEROPERABILITY
    The standard "make test" test suite checks most elements in a small
    range of test NITF documents obtained from the Net. You can find the
    test documents in the "t/test_data/" directory.

BUGS and TODO
    There are probably bugs all over the place -- this is still an early
    version.

    At the moment, "Syndication::NITF" only reads NITF files -- in the
    future it should be able to modify and write them as well.

    See TODO for what I'm thinking of building and what would be nice to have.
