TODO

    * Allow creation/modification of NITF documents as well as just reading
    them
    * A Syndication::NITF::Simple type module that takes the pain out of
    accessing all these methods.
    * Better error checking
    * Better handling of error reporting -- don't just croak() every time
    something goes wrong
    * POD docs of each class (!)
    * Integration with Syndication::NewsML module
    * Finish off test suite (need more examples!)
    * More support code: nitf-table handlers, ID schema helpers, etc
    * More useful example parser
    * The rest of the TODO list ;-)
  Would be nice
